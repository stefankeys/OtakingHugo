We quickly moved out of the dungeon hoping to get our reward. Most of the contents in the chest were food crops stolen from the farmers. Nothing of any value to me.

We started making our way out of the orc lair and I put out the light from my torch. I was very tired now but I wanted to make it back to the town to get our reward quickly. The others seemed to be of the same mind. The sun was starting to go down and the wilderness was getting darker.

“Can you heal my wounds?” I asked Lyndis.

“I can’t,” she replied in her usual angry manner. Did this mean she is unable or unwilling to heal me? It could be both so I dare not ask. She seemed pretty wounded too, more than I was so maybe she was unable to heal me anyway.

“Aren’t you a cleric?” asked Dazai, the Dwarf.

“I have only being initiated into the cult of Kalmera, the Goddess of Miracles.”

“Wait a moment!” I said suddenly realizing something. “I thought you couldn’t speak common!”

To which she just shrugged and moved on past me. That bit-titted broad, Helen must have lied to me to get me to pay the fees to join the adventurer’s guild for two new members for the Adventurer’s guild. Damn it all! I would still be getting half of Lyndis’ rewards for this quest, maybe I should ask for more.

Just as I was internally cursing at myself for my gullibility. A dog instantly teleported 60 feet in front of us. It was a medium-sized dog, light brown in colour and short-haired. It seemed wounded in its face. Blood and saliva were dripping down from its mouth.

We took out our weapons and were ready to fight.

It immediately started barking at us and then and teleported 60 feet behind us. It then simply ran away and kept teleporting away.

“Lucky!” I said.

“No, you idiot,” replied Dazai. “Whatever hurt that dog might still be around.”

“Exactly,” added Lyndis. “Blink dogs hunt in packs but this one was alone.”

“Then what are we waiting for.” I said, “Let’s hide now!”

I moved off of the path and hid behind a bush and some trees. Dazai and Lyndis followed me.

“You keep looking at the path,” said Dazai. “I will have your backs.”

There was no sound for a few minutes as I and Lyndis, the elf crouched behind the bush whereas Dazai was short enough to be hidden behind the bush while being fully erect.

Suddenly we could hear the sound of dogs barking in the distance slowly getting louder. As we waited there a pack of blink dogs appeared and disappeared while running in the same direction as we had come and as the first blink dog had gone towards.

Then suddenly with no warning, a green dragon flew down and picked clawed a blink dog that phased into existence and bit another. It flew back up and then came back down to kill some blink dogs.

Soon the pack of blink dogs and the dragon were gone. We still waited there behind the bush for a moment to take in what had happened. There was the carcass of the dog the dragon had clawed and I approached it. I poked it with my long sword.

“It seems pretty dead,” I said.

The others also moved out of the bush. At that moment I suddenly heard a loud buzzing sound coming from the wilderness.

A giant fly came out from where I heard the buzzing. It then just plopped to the ground. I readied my weapon. Dazai scrambled to get his sling ready. Lyndis was ready to fight as I was.

I slashed at it but it immediately flew away as quickly as a normal fly would. Lyndis tried the same with her quarterstaff and it went just as well.

I tried slashing at it again and failed again. My arms were getting tired and I simply let my blade hit the ground.

Lyndis scored a hit on it unexpectedly but it was not enough to kill it though now it buzzed a bit less loudly and we could hear each other. A bullet from Dazai’s sling nearly hit the fly but the fly avoided it at the last moment and turned at a ninety-degree angle to attack Lyndis.

The fly evaded Lyndis’ quarterstaff easily. Lyndis moaned in pain as it bit her shoulder. I took this opportunity when the fly was not moving to slash it with my sword off of her shoulder into the ground. Lyndis fell to her knees and the fly was dead.

Rewards for current quest: 14 platinum pieces for each adventurer. The quest giver was called Bartholomew, the mayor of the town.

Idea: Characters will have to return with a representative from the adventurer’s guild to prove they have killed the Orcs. And then they will find the entrance to the Noria mines.
