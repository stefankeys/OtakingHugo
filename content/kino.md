Kino’s Journey is a philosophical anime and I would say that it has got some political satire in it. Kino and Hermes(a talking motorbike) travel from country to country where they encounter and interact with different characters. Kino stays in each country for only 3 days. Most of the characters are there only for just one episode- Kino and Hermes being the only characters present in the whole series. The irony in it is that some of the side characters get more character development than Kino and Hermes. We do get to know a little bit about Kino’s past but that’s it. The Kino that is there at the beginning is the same Kino that is there at the end of the story.

However do not be put off by what I say about this anime cause you’ll be missing something that by the end of the show could make you a better person as a reviewer on MAL noted. I always tend to find faults in things and that episode about censorship, critiques and authors was extremely funny. Each episode examines a certain aspect of the human condition and what I liked about this show is that it does not always try to shove down your throat an ideology but instead makes you think. Some political problems are also discussed although I would argue that most of the show is concerned with Kino’s existential journey.

If you are wondering what gender Kino is well she is a female. The animation style is what some would call “childish” kind of reminded me of Detective Conan/Case Closed. The show is able to grab the viewers attention without having to frequently introduce some character with large breasts and all of those anime tropes (although to be honest I don’t personally mind those anime tropes once in a while).

I do highly recommend this show but then my tastes and your tastes might not be the same- it certainly is not everyone’s cup of tea but it certainly is worth it to sip a little bit of the tea to taste it- you might even end up liking it.
