- [Peter Hitchens Blog](https://hitchensblog.mailonsunday.co.uk/): British Columnist's blog hosted on TypePad. Very effective use of fonts, no. of words per line, red highlighted text etc.. I never had any trouble reading his blog though that list of "rightmind" blogs is a waste of space as most of those blogs are not updated anyway.
- [Hitchens Debates Transcripts](https://hitchensdebates.blogspot.com/): Transcripts from Christopher Hitchens Debates mainly on Atheism vs. God
- [Encyclopedia Dramatica](https://encyclopediadramatica.wiki/): Read it for AE-tan. Wikipetan is a worthless psychopathic whore and a serial molester.
- [The Nihon Review](https://web.archive.org/web/20170512030033/http://www.nihonreview.com/anime): Anime Review Site that I used to read with a very simple and beautiful layout reminding me how cute Haruhi is despite what a bitch she is. It also has live action reviews and music reviews but I never read them back then but I might do that now. I was pretty sad to find out that it had stopped posting reviews, they were pretty simple and neet.
- [Flipside](http://flipside.keenspot.com/): A manga style web comic which looks okay for a web comic. It has been going on forever the artist adding a page every week or so. While it is not the best nor the fastest I congratulate the artist for not giving up and abandoning the project.
- [Web Fiction Guide](http://webfictionguide.com/)A User Review Site for Original English Web Novels (or Web Serials as they call them). Basically stories posted online on websites and forums one chapter per week like anime episodes rather then as whole book. The admins are looking to migrate the site to lavarel or something because wordpress gutenburg is fucking useless (never use the cancer which is wordpress). The layout will change to some modern responsive crap because of touch phone plebs who have ruined the internet both in content and web design but at least I am glad the admins have decided to plod on rather than give up.
- [Top Web Fiction](http://topwebfiction.com/)Voting site for Web Serials run by the admins at webfiction guide. I have found quiete a few good original english web novels through it.
- [Space Battles Forums](https://forums.spacebattles.com/forums/creative-writing.18/): A Decent Forum for fan fiction as well as original fiction.
- [Royal Road](https://www.royalroad.com/fictions/best-rated): Website with ugly design and annoying ads for adblock users which sometimes censors stuff to please the advertising Gods at google. Nevertheless they are the most popular (wattpad doesn't count) website for original english web fiction
- [Fanfiction.net](https://www.fanfiction.net/): Fan fiction site which can be cesorious but still has some good fanfics due to how old it is. Don't see it as often in search results as I used which may be for the better and for the worse.
- [Fictionpress](https://www.fictionpress.com/): Site for original fiction only by the admins of fanfiction.net
- [Archive of Our Own/AO3](https://www.archiveofourown.org/): Superior fanfiction site than fanfiction.net which censors a lot less. Permanently in beta for some reason. Can be a bit anal about posting links to donation links on original fiction posted (technically I am not even sure that original fiction is allowed for some reason even).
- [Andor's Trail](https://andorstrail.com/): Forum for a free open-source (not all assets unfortunately) "Roguelike RPG" on Android. It doesn't have the more annoying aspects of rogue-likes like having to eat all the time, permadeath(there is the option for it if you are feeling particularly masochistic), inventory limits(at least I haven't hit that yet) and random maps. It has quests like RPGs but it also let's you go around and get yourself killed easily like in roguelikes.
- [Daily Hitchens](https://dailyhitchens.blogspot.com/): Old Blog on Christopher Hitchens
- [Day with the Cart Driver](http://daywith.thecartdriver.com/): Old Episodic Anime Blog which moved to shit modern website template because he couldn't be bothered to fix his old pleasing to the eye template. This is why you don't use wordpress or anything which you don't know how it works.
- [Fantastic Memes](http://fantasticmemes.wordpress.com/): Nice anime blog which has been abandoned ever since Frogkun, the author, stopped being a blogger and instead sold his soul to the editors at ANN in order to become a "journalist" which to be fair is a pretty good deal for a writer. He reads moonrunes and likes light novels. Has a slightly annoying feminist slant sometimes but if you can ignore that it is pretty solid. Sometimes I feel like Frogkun may be a woman but I don't care enough to look it up. From what I gather he is an australian of asian descent (probably euro dad and asian mom from the philliphines or something, women marry up after all) and he did some sort of interesting but useless in terms of employment uni stuff while doing his blog and some jp-en translation work on the side. Then got hired by Anime News Network (I spit in their general direction) thanks to some connections he made on twitter or something thanks to his blog which saved his/her ass after the uni stuff delaying tactic was over and fucked off to Japan where he is too busy with work to bother with the humble roots of his blog.
- [The Pantless Anime Blogger](https://thepantlessanimeblogger.wordpress.com/): Philiphino anime reviewer who lives in his country of origin and works as a teacher occasionally pushing out massive detailed anime reviews with a few editorials in between. He has quite a many reviews too which is splendid considering how long each othem is. I wish I had a teacher who was into anime when I was going to school. Dislikes anime adapted from light novels. Through some misterious means he has found a way to remove the obnoxious wordpress.com ads/banners on free blogs. He did have a domain name for a while so I suspect it has something to with messing about with the css back then and those changes not being reverted but who knows.
- [AlternativeTo](https://alternativeto.net/): User-Generated Alternatives to software. A good place to find open source software too
- [r/MUD](https://old.reddit.com/r/MUD/): A sub-reddit forum about MUDs(Mulit User Dungeons) basically text-based mmorpgs that can be played by a commmand-line like interface.
- [/jp/](https://boards.4channel.org/jp/): Otaku Culture board on 4chan.
- [ELDRITCHDATA](https://eldritchdata.neocities.org/): Personal site with stuff about software and privacy. Very tiny text. White text on black background looks tinier than black on white text of the same font size for some mysterious reason I am not bothered to look up so that might be a factor. Hates brevity and so calls Linux GNU/Linux. Even though technially true it is a mouthful. Brevity is the soul of wit.
