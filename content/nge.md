> Man fears darkness, and so he scrapes away at the edges of it with fire.”

> Kaji: “There are as many truths as there are people.”
> Kensuke: “But there’s only one truth that’s your truth. That’s the one that’s formed by whatever narrow point of view you choose to view it from. It’s a perception that protects you from the twisted truth.”
> Toji: “That’s true, and one can have a perspective that is far too small.”
> Hikari: “But a person can only see things from the perspective they choose.”
> Asuka: “One must learn to judge all things via the perceived truths that one receives from others.”
> Misato: “For example, sunny days make you feel good.”
> Rei: “Rainy days make you feel gloomy.”
> Asuka: “If you are told this is so, that is what you will believe to be so.”
> Ritsuko: “But you can have fun on a rainy day as well.”
> Fuyutsuki: “Your truth can be changed simply by the way you accept it. That’s how fragile the truth for a human is.”
> Kaji: “A person’s truth is so simple that most ignore it to concentrate on what they think are deeper truths.”

> “I still don’t know where my happiness lies…I’ll still think about why I’m here and whether or not it was good to come back…but that’s just stating the obvious, over and over…I am myself.

>
> “Humanity is probably the only creature capable of hating its own kind”
>
> I’m not going to feel sorry for you. If you don’t like feeling pain then you can just sit here an die. Crying isn’t going to solve anything, either! You hate yourself, don’t you? That’s why you hurt others. Deep down you know that you suffer more when you cause someone else pain, than if you just let yourself get hurt. But, Shinji, that was YOUR decision, so that makes it a valid choice. That was what you wanted, so that makes it worthwhile. Stop lying to yourself, and realize that you DO have options. Then accept the choices you’ve made.”

> You misunderstood from the very beginning. You just believed what you wanted to believe.
>
> I guess I just do things like that to prove I exist.
>
> I see. it’s just like when I first started playing the cello. I thought if I came here, I would find what I was looking for.
>
> I know all about your little jerk off fantasies about me. Go ahead and do it like you always do. I’ll even stand here and watch you. If I can’t have you all to myself, then I don’t want anything from you.
>
> Reality can be painful, but it’s something that you must learn to accept.
>
> Nobody wants me, so they can all just die. Nobody cares whether or not I exist. Nothing ever changes, so they can all just die! It would be better if I never existed. I should just die, too. Is it okay for me to be here?
>
> Liar. Anyone will do. You don’t care who it is! You’re afraid of Misato, and the First Child! You’re afraid of your mother and father, too! So now you come running to me because that’s the easiest way to keep from getting hurt! You never even loved yourself! You’re all you have, and you never learned to like yourself! Pathetic.

Neon Genesis Evangelion literally “Gospel of a new Century” is a post-apocalyptic anime, with mechas(Giant-robots), conspiracy theory elements, religious symbolism(ALL over the place), a cast of characters who constantly compete against each other at being mentally fuc\*ed up and a plot with enough plot holes to sink… okay I should stop, because even if what I’ve said till now is true, I actually would like you to watch this show, and let me explain to you why.

The Story:

The plot is quite straightforward, or at least that is what I thought while I was watching the first few episodes. The anime is set in a futuristic Tokyo fifteen years after the second impact(caused by a secret experiment by the United Nations), a catalytic event which caused the dissolving of the ice caps, death of all marine species, higher sea levels… long story short, it was a fuc\*ing mess. Now the world had just started to recover but giant monsters oddly enough called Angels attack Tokyo-3, the new capital of Japan(the old one has been flooded in the second impact). It is in the middle of this mess that Shinji Ikari is called to Tokyo by his (rather cold-hearted) father who is also the head of NERV, apparently an organization under direct jurisdiction of the United Nations(Can you see the conspiracy theory aspects popping up). Shinji is then made to pilot a bio-mechanical giant humanoid robot called EVA-01(you have a reference to Genesis in the bible there) apparently because only children who have been born just after the second impact can pilot them. The show then goes on as sort of a monster of the week structure but then quickly turns away from it towards the characters and introduces new mysterious elements like SEELE (A secret organization compromised by a bunch of mysterious old men discussing the fate of the world while sitting around a table and they also in control of NERV, well they basically somekind of illuminati like people) and the Dead Sea Scrolls which apparently predict everything that has happened and is to happen, the mysterious being called Lilith at the bottom of Nerv. Are you confused yet?

Once I started watching this anime questions kept on popping up and piling up, popping up and pilling up and only when I reached the last few episodes did I realize that none of them will be answered.

The Characters:

Shinji Ikari- Shinji is the main character of evangelion and one of the most widely hated characters that the anime industry has ever created. The reason for this hatred is mainly his constant inability to face the problems in front of him, his lack of any self-worth at all, his inability to have any good interpersonal relationships, and his constant running away from everything and everyone. Oddly enough it is what makes Shinji irritating that makes him relateable to the viewer. When I say relateable I don’t mean it in the sense that any of us has had to pilot a giant robot to defend the human race but then there are many other things that can make people depressed and from which they may be constantly running away. Just think of Shinji of some sort of character whose personality is solely constituted of all the dissatisfaction in your life, I think of him like that.

Asuka Langley Soryu- is the pilot of EVA unit-03. She has a completely different personality outwardly but faces almost the same problems as Shinji. From the start we are introduced to her as a very aggressive, self-confident, proud, energetic and better at everything that Shinji can’t do properly. However it is only later that we realize that unless she is praised by basically everything around her then her self-worth goes down to Shinji levels. And it gets worser and worser as the series goes on. It almost looks as if Shinji’s feelings are contypeious. Strangely enough I liked her character as well.

Rei Ayanami- I don’t why some people like her character, I just find her creepy as she has got no personality. She is the mysterious girl who pilots EVA unit-00. And when I say that she has got no personality I mean it, she just doesn’t feel human to me and for me she is more like a caricature of what a person would look like with no personality. I can somewhat relate to other two Eva pilots but not to her, not at all. You’ll get what I mean after you watch the show.

Misato Katsuragi- She usually the one in charge of the operations at Nerv against the Angels. Well, in my opinion she is the sanest of the characters in this show (as sane as you can get in the world of Evangelion). She is the one I can relate to the most in the sense that even if she has got a not-so-happy past, she can momentarily set her past aside and think of the problem she has at hand. I think that most people are that way. She is also in charge of looking after Shinji and Asuka and even if I wouldn’t say that she is the best of role models I think she did well, and acted quite rationally(something very rare in evangelion) throughout the series.

All of the main characters have got a back story that explains their personalities but I do not want to spoil the whole thing for you. Now there are many more characters that are mentally fuc\*ed up in their own special and individual ways but this post will get too long if I get into the details.

My opinion:

Well, so do I recommend this show? YES watch it (but please do not expect everything to magically explain itself, like I did. You’ll be disappointed). I say that you should watch this because it’ll make you think and generally speaking things that make you think are good. I also think that besides the unignorable problems with the plot it is a pretty decent experience watching this show.

By the way if the plot made no sense at all to you (as it did not to me) after watching both the series and The End Of Evangelion) then watch the video in the link down. Remember watch it only AFTER having watched the series.

However one thing that I’ve realized after watching the video above, is that plot is pretty preposterous anyway, it feels like it was made after the series had ended, but to be frank it doesn’t matter. What matters is that you enjoy the philosophical and psychological aspects of this show, I don’t think there is much else to be taken from this show, well you might as well enjoy the visual aspects of this show- the artwork is pretty good, the animation is not(especially during the last 2 episodes), the sound tracks are pretty good as well, some of them are among my favorites, notably the opening theme. Oh and there is some fan service as well if you’re into that thing.

The Rating: 4/5, I would have given it 5/5 if wasn’t for the mess that the last two episodes were.( And the innumerable number of plot holes that SEELE created)
