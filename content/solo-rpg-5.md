I started walking towards the corridor. The floor beneath me suddenly gave in and I began falling into a pit that was covered. Dazai pulled me back and I ended up not op of him. Dazai cursed at me in Orcish.

“Watch where you are walking!” he said. I told I was sorry but he didn’t seem convinced. Today wasn’t a very lucky day.

We walked around the pit. It was about ten feet deep. Lyndis peeked around the corner and then motioned us to move forward.

When we turned around the corridor opened into another room. It was about twenty by twenty feet. The entrance was wide enough for an orc or for two of us. Lyndis and I walked forward wielding our weapons and Dazai followed.

There were two orcs waiting for us. One of them seemed normal but the other was two feet taller and wearing chainmail and wielding a shield.

The normal came right straight to me but it was too obvious so I simply pointed my longsword in his way and he stopped advancing. The large orc approached Lyndis but she did the same as I and the large orc stopped approaching her too.

Dazai launched a bullet at the orc’s face past my head making me flinch. Taking this opportunity I plunged my sword into the stomach of the distracted orc. I pulled my sword up and the Orc simply fell forwards in front of my feet as moved back to avoid the falling orc. Unfortunately, Dazai was standing right behind me so I just fell backwards on top of the dwarf. We quickly got up and glared at each other.

“You nearly hit me with that bullet!” I said angrily.

“My aim is second to none!” declared the dwarf dubiously.

While we were bickering Lyndis had beaten the large Orc without taking any damage somehow. Both I and Dazai looked at the downed orc.

We looked around the room but couldn’t find any more obvious exists so figured that we had killed all of the Orcs. Just as we were about to leave the walls straight ahead of us started shaking and they slowly slid open. Another large orc appeared from that new entrance.

The orc was wearing chainmail looked much bulkier than the downed large orc. Dazai was already in the room behind us when he turned back to look at what was going on. He hurried to load his sling but it slipped out of his hands and he had to pick it up.

I rushed towards the large orc before it could do anything struck my sword across its neck killing it immediately. At least I hoped by doing this I would save some face for my blunders thus far.

I cautiously moved forward towards the new entrance in the wall. There was a large chest resting on the side of the otherwise bare room.

“Shall I open it?” I asked.

“No, let me open it.” replied the dwarf and Lyndis the elf didn’t even reply to me. Dazai examined the chest first.

There are no traps on it he declared and opened it with glee in his face which disappeared as it quickly as it appeared.

There were only 6 silver pieces and 1 electrum piece in there. Altogether a little bit more than a single gold piece. The dwarf took the electrum piece worth 5 silver pieces and I and Lyndis got 3 silver pieces each.

Rewards for current quest: 14 platinum pieces for each adventurer. The quest giver was called Bartholomew, the mayor of the town.

Idea: Characters will have to return with rep from the adventurer’s guild to prove they have killed the Orcs. And then they will find the entrance to the Noria mines.
