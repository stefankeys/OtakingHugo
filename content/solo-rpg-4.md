We entered a room of about 30×30 feet held up by four identical stone pillars. There was an angry orc waiting for us. The Orc did not wear any armour and it seemed to have breasts so it was probably a female even though they all looked the same to me. The orc seemed like it just woke up from lying down so it was surprised. I was distracted by my torch so I looked as surprised as the silent orc. Lyndis was prepared for combat and our dwarf seemed unprepared as well.

Lyndis approached the confused looking orc and rammed her quarterstaff in the orc’s eye-socket. The orc screamed loud enough for anyone within the caves to hear.

While I was still fumbling around, Dazai the dwarf launched a bullet from his sling straight into the wound in the orc’s eye-socket bringing its misery to an end. The Orc simply fell down while bleeding from its eye-socket.

Before I had even noticed another two orcs had approached from two different directions. One from the corridor in front of us and the other from the entrance to the room to our left. Lyndis turned her staff towards one of them and Dazai loaded another of his bullets aiming at the one that came through the adjacent room.

The orc attacking Dazai tried to punch the dwarf but he simply scurried away behind me. Typical dwarf. The other orc, however, punched Lyndis in her stomach past her quarterstaff pushing her a few feet backwards. There was some blood from the corner of her lips but she just seemed angry though not as much as she was towards me even if I didn’t punch her in her stomach. Lyndis tried to counter-attack but her movements were sluggish and she missed entirely. I was distracted by her and so I missed too. The Orc in front of me didn’t seem too impressed and I was embarrassed.

The Orc tried to punch me but I threw myself away and its fist simply passed over Dazai’s head who was behind me but a moment ago. The other orc tried to hit Lyndis again but this time she nimbly avoided its attack.

In that same step, Lyndis lurched forward and she beat the orc’s head with her staff knocking it back a few feet but it did not fall and simply growled angrily. Simultaneously Dazai launched a bullet from his sling at the orc we had surrounded or were running away from. The orc made an orcish noise and looked not too happily at the dwarf. I swung my sword at the orc getting its attention but I lost my balance and fell to the side. It was hard to fight while holding a torch for light.

The orc tried to kick Lyndis this time but she easily avoided it. Lyndis pushed herself forward once again and stroke the Orc with her quarterstaff. It barely grazed the orc. At the same time, Dazai hit the orc with a bullet from his sling straight to its chest. The orc winced as it touched its chest but immediately returned to its battle stance.

The Orc was distracted by Dazai, the dwarf so I just punched my sword through its torso. One Orc down. Dazai cursed in Dwarfish and said, “Don’t think that makes up for acting like an idiot till now!”

I simply looked down and then away towards the other Orc and Lyndis as if to say let’s go help her. The orc briefly looked at the downed orc and renewed its vigour to attack. It angrily charged at Lynidis and missed entirely and now it was surrounded by the three of us. Lyndis tried to hit it as it charged but she only managed to barely hit its knee which made it stumble but it soon regained its footing. Dazai took this opportunity to launch a bullet at its head killing it instantly.

“Finally,” I exclaimed.

“We have only just begun.” replied a cheeky dwarf.

Lyndis simply sighed at us.

Rewards for current quest: 14 platinum pieces for each adventurer. The quest giver was called Bartholomew, the mayor of the town.

Writing Tip: Don’t write the results for rolls, just write which dice you have rolled. So instead of “rolled 1d10 for 70” I should write “<<roll 1d10>>”

Idea: The cave is actually the entrance to an ancient abandoned mine called Noria.
