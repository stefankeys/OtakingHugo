“Watamote” is an abbreviation for “Watashi ga Motenai no wa dō Kangaetemo Omaera ga Warui!” which literally means- _No matter how I look at it, it’s you guys fault that I am not popular_

Plot- Fifteen-year-old Tomoko Kuroki believed that she would become popular upon entering high school because she’d become well-versed in the world of otome games. In reality, she finds that she has become an unsociable loner and she is forced to take a long hard look at herself for the first time in years. The story follows Tomoko as she attempts to improve her social status as she progresses through high school.

Most slice-of-life/comedy anime has always been unappealing to me; especially because of the improbable situations and self-fullfuling characters.( Well to be honest there might be nothing wrong in the characters per se but my Orwellian slightly pessimistic world view does not allow me to enjoy self-fullfuling caricatures whether they be in the comedy genre or elsewhere (eg. Sword Art Online).

However once in a while you do get some interesting slice of life anime/comedy shows ( E.g.Welcome to the NHK). These anime usually belong to the dark comedy sub – genre and so is Watamote. But don’t get me wrong when I say ‘ dark’ comedy that does **not** necessarily mean that it is not so funny show which discusses philosophical problems with jokes that only the likes of Stephen Hawkins can understand. On the contrary I found it extremely funny, full of many LOL moments and on some reflection I realised that at times I was laughing at my older self who seeked for the acceptance of others ( don’t get me wrong I do still seek the acceptance of others but I don’t think I am as delusional as I was, anymore). It is just entertaining to see how Tomoko fails at her( I would say ‘idiotic’) attempts to become popular. I think this show does well at illustrating the insecurities that some people ( especially those with social anxiety problems) go through during their adolescence and it does so by making fun of the whole thing so much that you may laugh even if you may have done a few of the _idiotic_ things she has.

One of the major complains about this series ( other than the animation which was okay for me (well I am no expert) but for others looked mediocre for a shoe aired in 2013) is that the characters do not develop and that the jokes get a little bit repetitive. When people complain about character development at most times it is specifically about the not improving situation of Tomoko- as I said Tomoko is not a self-fullfuling character but if you want to see her position improving at a realistic rate then read the manga chapter 30 onwards (where the plot in the anime stopped). If your complaint is not about Tomoko’s not improving situation but about character development in a more broader sense then I’ve to somewhat to agree with you but in my opinion the little bit of back story in the manga(Note- there are actually two extra small manga series and it is there where most of the back story is but first read the main manga) is enough for me. If your problem is the the repetitive jokes then that’s your problem cause that’s just the way this is, most of the humour comes from the somewhat repetitive jokes.

But for me Tomoko’s character makes up for it- the most interesting thing about her is that most of her pain is self-inflicted. I also like how she is perverted and is not trying to pretend to be virtuous. The main thing that I did not like about this characters personality was the mental insults that she hurled at people around her and the _idiotic_ assumptions that she made.

If you liked this anime then you’ll most probably like Welcome to the NHK which unlike Watamote goes beyond making fun of the problems we can face in life and tries to make a point. Both shows are great and helped me to look at life from a different perspective, both are funny and it is simply hilariously funny to see how they epically fail at their efforts. Oh and remember to read the manga(of watamote) after having watched the anime cause although it is fun to see Tomolo epically fail over the whole series it feels better when her situation slightly improves in the manga.

P.S. I wrote this whole thing on my mobile so if possible refrain from Grammar NAZI activities on my blog.
