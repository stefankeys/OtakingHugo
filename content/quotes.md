## Oregairu

- If the truth is a cruel mistress then a lie must be a nice girl
- Hard work betrays none, but dreams betray many.
- Life is too bitter, so coffee, at least, should be sweet...
- Marriage, the institution where one's existence goes to die. All married people prattle on about their so-called marital bliss about how they love saying "I'm home!" to their spouses, or how seeing their sleeping kids motivates them for tomorrow. But think about it: you can say "I'm home!" if you live your parents, you can even buy some mouthwash and say "I'm home!" to the hippos on the label. And if they're talking about seeing their sleeping kids, that just means they're working hellish overtime hours. How is that in any way blissful?
- They say that if you change yourself, you'll change the world. but that's a complete lie. They're just forcing you to compromise, by feeding you a convenient little fib.
- Relying on someone, helping each other out, and supporting each other. Most would say that's the right thing to do. However, that's just idealistic. In reality, someone always gets the short end of the stick.
- Excuses are meaningless. The tougher things get, the more likely people are to come to their own conclusions.
- "The important thing is to take part." Famous words spoken by Pierre de Frédy, Baron de Coubertin during a speech. However, this quote tends to be frequently misused and serves as kind of a threat to force participation. There are tons of wild-goose chases in this world, y'know. If the most important thing is to take part, then surely one could find meaning in not taking part as well. And if everything's worth experiencing, then there's little doubt that the feeling of not experiencing something is, in itself, worth experiencing. In fact, you could even call it a valuable experience to not experience something everyone else does.
- When a person loses their sense of belonging, they want someone else to hand it back to them on a platter.
- Now that just looks horrible. It's like some feudal society. If that's what it takes to make friends in this world, forever alone is fine by me.
- "You can't run away" is an ideal for the strong. You're not always wrong. Society, the world, the people around you - often someone else is in the wrong. To think that you can change is adapting to this cruel, indifferent, trashy world. It's admitting defeat and servility. You're simply deceiving yourself by dressing it up with pretty words.
- Question: The world will not change, but you can change yourself. So then, how will you change? Answer: You become the god of a new world.
- I hate nice girls. Just exchanging greetings with them will get them on your mind. Start texting each other, and your heart will be set a flutter. If they call you, you're done for. Enjoy staring at your logs and grinning like a fool. However, I won't get fooled again. That's what your kind calls kindness. If you're nice to me, you're nice to others. I always end up nearly forgetting that. Reality is cruel, so I'm sure lies are a form of kindness. Thus, I say kindness itself is also a lie. I always ended up with these expectations. And I always ended up with these misunderstandings. And before I knew it, I stopped hoping. A highly trained loner is once bitten, twice shy. As a veteran on this battlefield of life, I've gotten used to losing. That's why I always hate nice girls.

## Legend of the Galactic Heroes

- The greatest freedom is the freedom not to get involved.
- It’s the most powerful words in the world. No just argument or eloquence can stand a chance against it. It’s… ”So what?”

- The sin of dictatorship is that the people can push off the failures of government onto one man.
- A nation doesn't create individuals by cellular division. Instead it is individuals with autonomous intent who gather to estabilish a nation.

## Ashita no Joe

- It might not fit your definition of "enjoying my youth," but I've felt the fire in me flare up many times and give me a sense of accomplishment, up there in that bloody ring... My fire is nothing like those unfulfilled and incomplete combustions you see everywhere. It may be for a moment, but my fire roars up so bright and hot, it's almost blinding. And then, all that remains is pure white ash. There are no embers left...Just pure white ash.

## SDF Macross

- Is this what it feels like to be an officer in an army which is destined to lose

## Neon Genesis Evangelion

- No one can justify life by linking happy moments like a rosary. Especially me.
- I've made tons of stupid mistakes and later I regretted them. And I've done it over and over again, thousands of times. A cycle of hollow joy and vicious self-hatred. But even so, every time I learned something about myself.
- The thread of human hope is spun with the flax of sorrow.
- Man fears the darkness, and so he scrapes away at the edges of it with fire.

- To fall is to live
- You can't extract a god out of a human. However, by kowtowing to the thing that is considered to be a god, it is possible to create a god and shove it down the throats of people.
- Humans love beautiful things and fun things. We love extravagances and luxuries, so when a scientific genius translates our ideas into reality, it's like a previously poor man building a mansion. Suddenly, everyone's true character is revealed. No one should ever be scorned for it...As much as people love luxuries and beautiful, enjoyable things...There's still one more. The love of what's right. Call it justice if you like. Men love beautiful women, and women look for extravagances...It is human nature to have a love of justice beside a love of pure chaos... Everyone has desires they can't tell anyone about. It goes without saying. But where is your sense of what's right?
- I have a question. Why do you reveal the truth? Is there always one truth?

## The World God Only Knows

## The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya

- Say, have you ever realized how insignificant your existance is on this planet? I have. During elementary school when I was in sixth grade the whole family went to a baseball game at the stadium. I wasn't particularly interested in baseball but I was shocked once we got there. There were people everywhere I looked. The ones on the other side of the stadium looked like squirming grains of rice all packed together. I wondered if every last person in Japan had gathered in this place. And so... I asked my day. Exactly how many people there were in the stadium? His answer was that a sold-out game meant around fifty thousand people. After the game, the path to the station was flooded with people. The sight stunned me. So many around me... yet they only made up a fraction of the people in Japan. Once I got home, I got a calculator and did the math. We learned that the Japanese population was a hundred million and some in social studies. Divide fifty thousand into that...and you only get one two-thousandth. I was stunned again. Not only was I just one little person in that sea of people in that stadium... but that sea of people...was merely a drop in the ocean. I had thought myself to be... a special person up until that point. I enjoyed being with family...and most of all I had thought that my class in my school had the most interesting people in the world. But... that was when I realized it wasn't like that. The things that happened in what I believed to be the most enjoyable class in the world...could be found happening in any school in Japan. Everyone in Japan would find them to be ordinary occurrences. Once I realized this... I suddenly found that...my surroundings were beginning to lose their colour. Brush my teeth and go to sleep at night. Wake up and eat breakfast in the morning. People do those everywhere. When I realized that everyone did all thse things on a daily basis...everything started to feel so boring. And if... there were so many people in the world...there had to be someone living an interesting that wasn't ordinary. I was sure of it. Why wasn't that person me? That's all I could think about...until I graduated from elementary school. And in the process, I realised something. Nothing fun will happen if you sit around waiting. So I figured I would change myself in middle school. Let the world know that I wasn't a girl content with sitting around and waiting. And I conducted myself accordingly. But in the end, nothing ever happened. Before I knew it, I was in highschool. I thought something would have changed.
- By sketching the beauty of our fleeting dream, we're just tracing our scars.
