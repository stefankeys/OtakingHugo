Intelligence is overrated this is why nonsensical terms such as ‘Emotional Intelligence/IQ’ have been injected into the English language when perfectly fine terms such ‘empathy’ and ‘social skills’ are available. Everybody needs to be intelligent because intelligence is clearly identified as a certificate for status but if everybody is intelligent in their own way then term ‘intelligence’ ceases to bear any meaning whatsoever or it would if people actually believed in ‘everybody is intelligent’ piffle which even those who pay lip service to don’t.

The criteria for intelligence is self-evident and those with the cognitive capabilities to prove it are rewarded for it socially and economically if they can harness it in a commercially viable way, i.e. people in the STEM field, some artists and social commentators, basically people with high IQs.

Tradesmen such as builders, electricians, plumbers, carpenters and so on are looked down upon for their apparent lack of intelligence and therefore there is an incentive among young people to pursue university education in subjects that will not get them a job, in the name of ‘dreams’ when in fact it is done out of a misplaced sense of vanity and a disdain for blue-collar work(ers). A similar illness afflicts bookish people.

A sort of ‘I am too good/intelligent for that’ attitude prevails. The problem is that to be a part of let alone advance in these oversubscribed non-STEM field subjects that are considered to be intellectual such law, art, journalism etc… a lot of nepotism is involved because it isn’t as clear as in STEM field subjects what credentials and skills you need to do the actual work.

I believe that the state should play an active role to provide more places and funding to enter those fields for which there is a demand for in the employment market and also perhaps introduce some mandatory counselling for all high school students asking them what their future prospects are leaving school realistically, and telling students to avoid certain subjects depending on their economic situation, for example if the economic situation in the family of a student is not secure then it would hardly make sense to get a degree in philosophy, gender studies etc… Or else when their misplaced sense of vanity in their intelligence is not rewarded they will become bitter and feel that they have not been treated fairly for being placed so low in the pecking order, and in a way they are right because had they been treated right they would not be so ignorant as to assume that their perceived intellectual proficiency would (and should) entitle them to a higher place spot in the food chain. Intelligence is only valuable when it is useful, and unless it is used for some economically productive activity then that intellect will not be rewarded because it does not provide any service to anyone(well at any rate any service that anyone is interested in) to warrant their recognition (and their money).

Someone who is not very cerebral can be very productive and useful too but pretending that they are differently intelligent or some other nonsense is not going to lead to that. Intelligence can be one of the most useful characteristics to have with a dose of self-awareness but without that it is nothing more than a hindrance blunting judgement and fostering a useless sense of superiority over others which often leads to bitterness – when they see less intelligent people doing better than them at life doing some activity that does not involve as much intellectual capabilities they will feel betrayed.
