You did what you shouldn’t have, and didn’t do as you should have. Because you relied on someone else’s script, you were wrong. I won’t live my life by another person’s script. Not by Hamlet or The Tempest. I don’t know how many years in the future it will be… but I’ll write and act my own ending.”

One day, a sorceress princess was stuffed into a barrel and banished.
One day, a single girl was suddenly murdered, and the culprit still runs free.
And one day, a battle spanning time and space over magic and revenge began!
Sanity and madness, sense and intelligence, self-confidence and convictions.
The tragic tale of this irrational world starts now.(Source:Aniplex USA)

A very interesting anime indeed, the first half of this anime is like a detective anime with the characters trying to outwit each other with logic. In the second half it fell into self conscious comedy, but I liked both of the two arcs. The characters occasionally quote Shakespeare throughout the series, sometimes it can be quite annoying but even if you don’t know what they mean you get the sense some kind of higher art form when they quote Shakespeare. Anyways this is a series that I did not expect to like as much as I do- of course it has got its flaws like the improbable romance in the second arc and the fact that excluding the main characters most of the other characters are little more than one dimensional caricatures. There is some fan service too but I don’t see that as being inherently bad, it’s OKAY to have a little bit of fanservice as long as it’s not just about that. So well, I think there is much left for me to say about this series… whilst I did not find it ground breaking… I did certainly enjoy it.
