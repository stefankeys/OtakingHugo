I have been wondering why although I share an enemy with traditionalists I still feel a disdain for them from back when I was a lefty. The traditionalists are stoics and when I think of stoicism what comes to mind are those bored, disappointed, miserable looking faces of the statues of Marcus Aurelius that make the visages of Jesus in pain nailed onto a cross look happy and manly by contrast. Stoics can be romantic in their quest for order but this is only true because their quest for order has thus far being unattainable.

Traditionalists are pacifists at heart and like a pacifist who believes that war is cruel and not glorious so too the traditionalists see chaos as cruel and therefore evil. I may have already said this on this blog but the reason that the left wins eventually is just because the “good times” that “strong men” bring are deadly boring times too, certainly not what the Chinese called “interesting times.” The reason I hate the left too so much is because they have gotten used to being in power, the spark of revolutionary zeal has been lost in righteous larping and calculations about the consequences of their actions now that they are in power have driven their thinking to the ground but this post is not about the left. Also before accusing me of righteous larping remember that fishing for hypocrisy is even worse than accusing your opponents of what you are guilty of.

What is the conservative, traditionalist, and stoic line? It is this, “Learn to be Bored.” Why do they say to avoid pornography(i.e. lust), violence (and even violent video-games), hatred, jealousy, gluttony, pride and so on? For the same reason that their line, “learn to be Bored” is so unconvincing. Because if you engage in these things then your expectations for life will be higher than what ordinary life has to offer and more likely than not your life is going to be very ordinary. The normalfags may call it “dopamine detox” or whatever in their cringey deadorated demeanours but it is the same thing – lower the expectations of stimulation in your life by lowering the amount (and frankly quality) of stimulation that you expect.

Many great (i.e. stimulating) things of course are the result of endless toil in boredom. Take anime for example, the glorious, lively, animated story of some hero you see on screen is the result of endless hours poured in by animators painstakingly and in contrast to the hero’s active life very boringly being etched into one frame after another by an animator sitting on a chair at a desk and what could be more boring than sitting on a chair at a desk? The process of creating something stimulating is often not very stimulating at all. You might say this makes it poetic or something but let me ask you this, is the animator drawing the hero in any way heroic at all? Is he anything more than a conduit for something that is actually worth anything while himself not being such a great figure at all? I recently came across a meme making fun of Hideaki Anno as the pinnacle of Japanese masculinity or something clearly as a response to all the fangasm directed at Anno by those who aspire to be like him but cannot.

Traditionalists (and even feminists) will blame anime, pornography as being blemished for warping the minds of its viewers about reality by giving them unrealistic hopes and dreams. Is that fiction failing reality or reality failing fiction?

I have made my point so now allow me to meander around it. People desire glamour and the left gives them hope for it through the unfulfilled promise of being able make their own souls. The conservative movement on the other hand seeks to ridicule this quest by joining in with the left’s ridicule of those who aspire to be great men by offering mediocrity through moderation for all on a silver plate and spoon feeding their followers with hope about another world or eudaimonia. On the other hand the right can’t of course stop gushing about great men when they feel like the left is not looking at them to laugh with their shrill laughter of (man)-children.

The playwright who writes the great play, the actor who plays the great man, and the scholar who comments about them all in public are all involved in an embellishment to glorify themselves by worshipping something, that something being the hero.

But what of the audience – well they, nay we ought to be inflicted with a deep sense of lack of accomplishment and either driven to despair or to action. Of course there is no guarantee that action will not lead to despair too – still far better than being comfortable in mediocrity. Isn’t there something perfectly despicable and gross in the little man with his small happiness that cannot be found in any wretch.

The reason that there aren’t enough great men today is because the development of photography and video reportage have made it harder to embellish strong men into something more than the truth, into something which can inspire greatness. I didn’t intend to come off so power-worshipping in this post but better a sycophant than one of those cringing, nitpicking, sweat-covered, nu-male ‘social commentators’ oozing ‘democratic values'(read: mediocrity) from their every pore.

But which role should the inflicted viewer seek to take on? The great man, the hero, is boring and uncouth in the flesh until the embellishments of poetry are sewn onto him by lesser men.

The artist has a lesser burden of tedium, the player even less and the commentator has the least of all which makes him the last and the most likely point of entry. And then what? He ought to climb up each role like steps on a ladder. Or in other words has got to, “Learn to be Bored.” It’s like grinding in a video game, a necessary evil not an end in itself to some satisfied peace.

See, I agree with them on the means just not their incredibly tedious goals that drive me away from them every time I am pushed closer to them.

I am not a gamer but if there is anything good to be found in video games then I think we need to go to their start. That is to old school Dungeon’s & Dragons. I have been reading a retro clone of D&D and although looking at the average gamer it may not seem obvious I have a feeling that the cure might be made of the poison itself. A kind of merging of many of the roles of the actor, the audience, the writer into one embellishment. Actual roleplay in particular might make a proper return in VR.
