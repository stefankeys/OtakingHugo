### Animals

### Places

- Kissaten: Japanese tea drinking shop
- Sekai: World
- Gakkou: School
- Kansai: Region in Japan with a quirky Japanese accent that comes out when Kansai people are excited.
- Osaka: Largest city in Kansai region. Smaller than Tokyo but pretty large still.
- Hokkaido: Largest Northern Japanese Island. Least populated, kind of shaped like a British colonial fort, cold and has some dairy farming going on according to anime.
- Kyoto: Japanese Shinto and Buddhist temples including the beautiful Temple of the Golden Pavillion about which Yukio Mishima wrote a novel about the original being burned down from the perspective of the arsonist.
- Chiba: Almost indistinguishable from Tokyo but distinct from Tokyo. Tokyo Disneyland is actually in Chiba.
- Okinawa: Popular island for anime school girls to go on school trips and wear bikinis. Also has a large US military base largely to deter the Chinese from fucking with Japan as the involvement of US military personnel would inevitably drag the US to defend Japan.
- Tokyo Tower: A beautiful red and white tower which is a copy of the eiffel tower but taller. Used to be the tallest in Japan until a much uglier Tokyo Skytree(spit) tower that like a large tube for all intents and purposes has replaced it. Tokyo Skytree (spit) is not as ugly as that black tower you can see from the eiffel tower in Paris.
- Kokkai-gijidō: The National Diet Building. The Japanese parliament looks like a prison from the outside and looks too spacious from the inside(like the French assembly or the chinese rubber stamp building). Also there is a ridiculous pyramid ontop when obviously a dome would have looked better. It looks like a failure to build a western style building to be honest.
- Jimintō: The Liberal Democratic Party has ruled Japan more or less continuosly since the Americans and Gen. MacArthur fucked off in 1955. It is neither Liberal, nor democratic and not even a party more like a bunch of tribal factions who tolerate each other in exchange for favours to their interest groups. They are not perfect but can be reasoned with and the reason they have remained in power is mainly because the Japanese opposition is a mess divided against itself 99.9% of the time.

### Objects

- Megane: Glasses
- Kuruma: Car
- Shinkansen: Japanese bullet train network
