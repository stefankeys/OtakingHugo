Un-Go is about some globalist tech giant CEO billionaire manupulating the media and hiding the truth for politically inconvenient crimes in order to work towards his utopian goals. Un-Go is based and redpilled.

Yuuki Shinjurou, the detective wants to reveal the truth, consequences be damned. He also has a loli/shota detective sidekick. The setting is a slightly futuristic post-war Japan. The government works with big tech billionaires to censor the media and social media. Truly a gem of an anime which has gone unnoticed.
