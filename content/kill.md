Ryuuko Matoi is a vagrant school girl traveling from place to place searching for clues to the truth behind her father’s death—the “woman with the scissor blade.” The journey has led Ryuuko to Honnouji Academy.



Honnouji Academy—where an elite group of students is granted superhuman power by their special uniforms called the “Goku uniform.” With the power of the uniform, the student body president, Satsuki Kiryuin rules the students with unquestioned power and fear.

Satsuki holds the secret to the “scissor blade” and Ryuuko confronts Satsuki to gain information but… Was their encounter a mere coincidence or fate? The clash between the two will soon consume the whole academy!

Okay, this one was well diffferent from what I usually watch. I don’t have anything against fanservice but I usually don’t watch stuff with a lot of fan service because shows like that usually do not have anything other than fanservice. This one was different and I enjoyed it, different in the sense that the fan service had a plot point to serve. And to be frank I think I enjoyed the excessive fanservice for its own sake as well at the beggining but by the end of the show I stopped noticing it. The music was good- the composer Hiroyuki Sawano is the guy who composed the music for Guilty Crown and Attack on Titan( If you do not know either of these shows, what I obviously mean is that the music is pretty good). As for the animation there are times when it is awesome and other times when it was bad CGI or 1995 like looking still images but the action sequences were usually good enough for me to ignore them- kind of reminded me Dragon Ball Z sometimes.

 

There were times when I felt the show was trying to insult my intelligence by trying to give me a “scientific” explanation for some “shi*” that randomly happened. You know like the main protagonist transforming into a rocket. The characters were all fun but they were all unreliastic, but well I do not think they were meant to be realistic any way- like the main character who hated her father but goes through all kinds of life-threatening and painful trouble to find her father’s killer.

I read somewhere on the internet that to enjoy this show you should “switch-off” your brain and it might as well be true to a certain extent. The reason being that certain aspects of this show are stupid but in the end I came to the conclusion that it was good for what it was. And it was- funny, predictable, action-packed, light-hearted and yet trying to be serious, full of fan service(which was fine by me), colourful and addictive.

If this review made you feel that this is a bad show then this review is a failure( well at least from my perspective) because I like this show and if you are searching for a show to watch, I do highly recommend this.
