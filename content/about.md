## A Little History About This Site

I know it is a shameful label according to the current zeitgeist of the internet but I think I am an individualist. At any rate I don't get along with online communities which is why I decided to set up my own personal site where I can say what I want without getting into useless arguments with others.

I have worked on and off on this website for much longer than I expected. Although I officially created this site on Sep 23, 2017, I didn't start actively working on this site until a couple of years later, even then I gave up on this site a few times for as long as 7 months in a row. This site is nothing to brag about, it barely gets a thousand views a day, but it is the online project I have put most work into so I am fond of it.

Honestly I am surprised that I haven't abandoned this site yet, and I will be even more surprised if I will have not abandoned this site in a couple of years. I am a very fickle man who can't be interested in one thing for a long time. In fact, a brief look around this site should reveal that I write about a lot of things because I can't just maintain my interest in one thing for too long.

## About Myself

I was born in 1997 in a little picturesque town in Tuscany on the Italian peninsula. My parents were immigrants from some tea drinking, cricket playing third world democratic socialist island republic. My main interest is [anime](http://localhost:65212/#a).

I have watched anime for as long as I remember, some of my earliest memories in life were watching anime. I moved across countries and continents but my interest did not waver and only has grown more intense each passing year.

These days I run a little [podcast about anime](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA4gWcOoz_FXrtTEemTOtfw) and related topics. Do [let me know](mailto:stefankeys@yahoo.co.jp) if you want to join, as I am always looking for members for the podcast. As with this website there is no guarantee for how long I'll be able to keep posting but I have had a pretty good run.

My hobbies include cycling, guitar playing, and going to the gym, so I do sometimes write about these though I try to stick to anime since that's the focus of this site. I suppose YouTube is another fixation of my life, and so I do write my reactions on YouTubers I watch on my [diaries](http://localhost:65212/#r9k).

I don't think these facts are important but since they might be of interest to some: I am of south asian descent, I am currently single and live somewhere in East (I guess?) Scotland.

I am an optimist but I prefer my optimism laced with pessimism (for flavour).

## Why 'Otaking?'

Because I am not ashamed of being an Otaku. If anything I am constantly worried that I don't know enough about anime or haven't done enough (like learning Japanese) to call myself an Otaku. Having that said I don't group myself together with other people who call themselves Otaku. I have my own standards, and though I may look at others for ideas, I will be the final judge of my conduct.

## Things That I Don't Like

- [**Politics**](http://localhost:65212/#pol): I used to write about politics but online politics is a loser's game so I try not to talk about it.

## Dead Writers Whom I Admire

There are people who are alive that I admire but people who are alive can and do change whereas the dead remain reliably the same. I wouldn't want to edit this list once I change my opinion of someone because of something they did or said.

- **Nietzsche**: His life was full of suffering and social failure but through will power and reason he lived a life full of joy and personal success. He showed an admirable individualistic unwillingness to yield to despair or inactivity. A bountiful spirit which gave to others out of a sense of abundance.
- **George Orwell**: An ordinary man and a competent and engaging writer that inspired me to start writing essays. A lot of writers can be intimidating and make you feel like why should you even bother when you can't reach their level but reading Orwell made me feel like writing was something that I could do too.
- **Christopher Hitchens**: A very good speaker and a well-read writer who did not posses many original ideas but always made sure to point you towards other writers. He got me interested in reading and in Orwell too.
